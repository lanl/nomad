# Tool Manager Reference

The tool manager is the runtime that makes multiple
{py:class}`nomad.fm_base_tool.TorchModuleTool` models practical to serve from a
single Nomad process. It keeps track of available devices, loads tools onto an
accelerator when they need to run, and can offload idle tools back to CPU so
GPU memory can be shared across a larger set of models.

It also queues requests, batches calls for tools that support batching, and can
register the managed tools with FastMCP.

For managed Torch tools, the manager keeps one resident CPU instance when the
tool is loaded from configuration and may create additional tool instances from
the configured source when a busy tool is assigned to more than one device slot.
Idle tools scale down one device allocation per
{py:attr}`~nomad.config.ToolManagerConfig.idle_seconds` interval. After a tool
is fully removed from device slots,
{py:attr}`~nomad.config.ToolManagerConfig.disk_idle_seconds` controls when the
resident CPU instance may be dropped; a later request reloads it with
`TorchModuleTool.from_pretrained(source)`. Separately,
{py:attr}`~nomad.config.ToolManagerConfig.gc_idle_seconds` controls when unused
Python and accelerator caches are cleared while the server is idle.
